# is the same one every repository in this family pins.

# and throw away the reproducibility the digest is pinned for. Drop this line

# Consequence worth knowing before you set SMTP_ATTACHMENT_DIR: files are read
# as uid 1000, so a bind-mounted host directory has to be readable by that uid
# on the HOST. Without SMTP_ATTACHMENT_DIR the server never touches the
# filesystem and this does not come up.

# stdio transport only — no port, no healthcheck. The server starts without

# it); every call then fails with setup instructions instead of reaching a
# server. It also starts unable to send: SMTP_ALLOW_SEND defaults to false.
