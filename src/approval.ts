 * Why this exists next to {@link ConfirmationStore}: the confirmation token is
 * not a human-in-the-loop gate and never was. It is returned inside a tool
 * result, which means the model reads it and can call again in the same turn
 * without anyone seeing the dialog. That still catches a model that widens the
 * recipient list by accident, but a model which has been talked into mailing
 * the customer list to a stranger will happily call twice.
 *
 * MCP elicitation closes that hole: the request goes to the client, which shows
 * it to the person sitting there, and the model cannot answer on their behalf.
 * Clients that cannot be asked fall back to the token, because refusing to work
 * at all would push people towards turning the guard off entirely — and on this
 * server the guard is one of the four things standing between a prompt
 * injection and an outbound message.
 *
 * The question is *returned*, not pushed. On the 2026-07-28 revision there is
 * no server→client request channel at all: the handler answers
 * `input_required`, the call ends, the person decides, and the client retries
 * carrying the answer. On a 2025 connection the SDK's legacy shim turns the
 * same return into the push it used to be — so this is written once and serves
 * both eras, which `elicitInput()` could not do: it throws outright on a
 * 2026-era request.
